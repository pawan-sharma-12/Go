# Pointers, Methods & Interfaces in Go

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Go's pointer system
- Learn method definitions and receivers
- Master interfaces and polymorphism
- Apply OOP concepts in Go's way

## Topics to Practice
1. **Pointers** - Memory addresses, dereferencing
2. **Method Receivers** - Value vs pointer receivers
3. **Interfaces** - Implicit implementation
4. **Type Assertions** - Working with interface types
5. **Embedding** - Go's approach to inheritance

## Files to Create
- `pointers.go` - Pointer basics, pass by reference
- `methods.go` - Method definitions, receivers
- `interfaces.go` - Interface definitions and usage
- `polymorphism.go` - Interface-based polymorphism
- `embedding.go` - Struct embedding examples

## Key Backend Concepts
- Pointer receivers for modifying structs
- Interfaces for dependency injection
- Error interface implementation
- HTTP handler interfaces
