# Concurrency in Go - The Heart of Backend Development

## Learning Objectives
- Master goroutines and channels
- Understand concurrent programming patterns
- Learn synchronization techniques
- Apply concurrency in backend systems

## Topics to Practice
1. **Goroutines** - Lightweight threads
2. **Channels** - Communication between goroutines
3. **Select Statement** - Multiplexing channels
4. **Sync Package** - Mutexes, WaitGroups
5. **Context Package** - Cancellation and timeouts

## Files to Create
- `goroutines.go` - Basic goroutine examples
- `channels.go` - Channel operations and patterns
- `select.go` - Select statement usage
- `sync.go` - Synchronization primitives
- `context.go` - Context for cancellation
- `worker-pool.go` - Worker pool pattern
- `pipeline.go` - Pipeline pattern

## Critical Backend Patterns
- **Worker Pools** - Processing multiple requests
- **Fan-out/Fan-in** - Distributing and collecting work
- **Pipeline** - Data processing stages
- **Rate Limiting** - Controlling request rates
- **Graceful Shutdown** - Clean service termination

## Real-world Applications
- HTTP request handling
- Database connection pooling
- Background job processing
- Real-time data streaming
- Microservice communication
