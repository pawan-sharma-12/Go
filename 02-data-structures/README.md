# Data Structures in Go

## Learning Objectives
- Master Go's built-in data structures
- Understand arrays vs slices
- Work with maps and structs
- Learn when to use each data structure

## Topics to Practice
1. **Arrays** - Fixed-size sequences
2. **Slices** - Dynamic arrays (most commonly used)
3. **Maps** - Key-value pairs (like dictionaries/hashmaps)
4. **Structs** - Custom data types
5. **Nested Structures** - Complex data modeling

## Files to Create
- `arrays.go` - Array operations and examples
- `slices.go` - Slice manipulation, append, copy
- `maps.go` - Map operations, iteration
- `structs.go` - Struct definition, methods
- `exercises.go` - Practice problems

## Key Concepts for Backend Development
- Slices are reference types (important for memory management)
- Maps are not thread-safe (important for concurrent programming)
- Structs are the foundation for modeling business entities
- JSON marshaling/unmarshaling with struct tags
